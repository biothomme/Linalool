# Coder's Bucket
This is my bucket list, to collect ideas and new challenges for programming.
## Coalescent
Try to get a code for the coalescent to infer population size history
## Mutation rates
Reconstruct the models of <i>Rozhok, A., DeGregori, J. Somatic maintenance impacts the evolution of mutation rate. BMC Evol Biol 19, 172 (2019) doi:10.1186/s12862-019-1496-y</i>.
